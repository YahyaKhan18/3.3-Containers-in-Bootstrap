    <div class="container bg-success">The lion inhabits grasslands, savannahs, and shrublands. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when
    persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. During the Neolithic period, the lion ranged throughout
    Africa and Eurasia, from Southeast Europe to India, but it has been reduced to fragmented populations in sub-Saharan
    Africa and one population in western India. It has been listed as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List since 1996 because
    populations in African countries have declined by about 43% since the early 1990s. Lion populations are untenable
    outside designated protected areas. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and
    conflicts with humans are the greatest causes for concern.</div><br>
